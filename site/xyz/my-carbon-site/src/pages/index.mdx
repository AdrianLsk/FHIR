## Running the IBM FHIR Server
The IBM FHIR Server is currently under development. To run the server you must clone or download the project and build it. See https://github.com/IBM/FHIR/wiki/Setting-up-for-development for more info.

Information on installing and running the IBM FHIR Server will be available in the User Guide at https://github.com/ibm/fhir/blob/master/docs/FHIRServerUsersGuide.md, but presently this document needs love/attention.

## Building on top of the IBM FHIR Server
IBM FHIR Server artifacts will become available on JCenter and Maven Central with a group ID of `com.ibm.fhir` in the near future.

For example, if you are using Maven and would like to use our object model (including our high-performance parser, generator, and validator), you could declare the dependency like this:

``` xml
...
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.ibm.fhir</groupId>
      <artifactId>fhir-model</artifactId>
      <version>${fhir.version}</version>
    </dependency>
    ...
</dependencies>
```
